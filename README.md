# Soquid Templates for Lua
Soquid is a templating "framework" designed to avoid any sort of fuss. Soquid enables you to write code in Lua instead of something else, enabling code reuse, simple integration, and very low complexity. The core parser and execution engine only about 150 lines of code!

See `demos` for some demonstrations of how Soquid can be used.

Soquid uses [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

## Future Features
